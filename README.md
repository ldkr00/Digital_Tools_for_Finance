# Final Project

## Topic
Is the Swiss franc a safe haven for US investors during recessions?

## Approach
We focus on the recessions of the last 40 years namely July 1981- November 1982, July 1990 - March 1991, March 2001 - November 2001, December 2007 - June 2009 and February 2020 - today. Using the S&P 500 returns over these periods and the exchange rate USD/CHF, we run an OLS regression to investigate wether there is a significant correlation. To have enough data we use daily or weekly returns which we get from Yahoo Finance. If our estimate from the regression is significantly negative then we have some evidence that investing in the Swiss franc during recessions might be a good choice for US investors.
