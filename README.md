# Digital Tools for Finance

In this branch we present the solutions to the six homework exercises of the Digital Tools for Finance course. Homework 3 gave us some trouble. While trying to revert the file notes.txt back to the state where it reads THIS IS FINE, the file becomes empty (see Homework3) since this step is overwritten in step 3. In Homework3_newattempt we only did it up to step 9 where everything still worked.
