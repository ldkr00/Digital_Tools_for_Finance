## Topic
Which of the G10 currencies is the riskiest to hold for a Swiss resident?

Is the Swiss franc a safe haven for US investors during recessions?

## Approach
We focus on the recessions of the last 40 years namely July 1981- November 1982, July 1990 - March 1991, March 2001 - November 2001, December 2007 - June 2009 and February 2020 - today. Using the S&P 500 returns over these periods and the exchange rate USD/CHF, we run an OLS regression to investigate wether there is a significant correlation.
